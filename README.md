# Bitcoin Transaction Analysis

A data analysis project exploring Bitcoin transaction patterns, exchange flows, and network visualization.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Bitcoin blockchain data to understand transaction patterns, identify major exchanges, and visualize cryptocurrency flows across the network. The analysis focuses on transaction frequencies, exchange identification, and network visualization.

## Features
- Transaction frequency analysis by address
- Exchange inflow and outflow tracking
- Visualization with interactive charts and graphs
- Network analysis of transaction relationships
- Temporal patterns in Bitcoin transactions

## Data Sources
The project uses the following data sources:
- Bitcoin blockchain data via Bitcoin Core API or public datasets
- Known exchange address lists from public repositories
- Historical Bitcoin price data for contextual analysis

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Bitcoin Core (optional for direct blockchain access)
- PostgreSQL or similar database for storing processed data

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-transaction-analysis.git
cd bitcoin-transaction-analysis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp config.example.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml with your settings
```

## what you need to know

First, I need to outline the typical workflow for this project. Usually, data analysis projects follow steps like data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. The user mentioned transaction frequency, exchange flows, and network visualization, so the steps should align with these goals.

Starting with data collection, the data-collection-script.py uses Bitcoin Core RPC or a public API to fetch blockchain data. You would need to run this script first to get raw data. Then, the transaction-analysis.py processes this data to identify high-frequency addresses and exchange flows. The exchange-analyzer(2).py further analyzes exchange-specific data and generates reports and charts.

Next, the visualization-code.py handles creating network graphs, which are probably used in the dashboard. The dashboard-code.py is the interactive web interface that displays all the visualizations and analysis results.


## The sequence of running these scripts. 

You start by collecting data, then process it, run the analysis, generate visualizations, and finally launch the dashboard. Each script depends on the previous step's output. For example, the transaction analysis needs the raw data from the collection script, and the dashboard needs the processed results and visualizations.

I also need to mention the dependencies and setup, like installing the required libraries from requirements.txt, setting up the configuration files, and ensuring directories like data/raw and results exist. The user might need to adjust the config.yml with their API keys or Bitcoin Core RPC credentials.

Potential issues could include missing data files, incorrect paths, or API limits. The user should make sure all file paths in the scripts match their project structure. Also, handling large datasets might require adjustments in parameters like max_transactions to manage memory usage.

Finally, the dashboard is launched with specific host and port settings, which the user can access via a web browser. The network visualizations might be linked as static HTML files or images generated by the visualization scripts.

Putting this all together, the explanation should guide the user through each step, from setup to running each script in order, ensuring they understand how each component fits into the overall workflow.
